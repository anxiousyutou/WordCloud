WordCloudTest
----------------------
In this project, I want to show how to use wordcloud module in python to creat wordcloud with Chinese.<br>
Two examples have been given. <br>
One of the examples set the background color to the color of image which is given in resources folder.<br>
The other is a simple one.<br>
Several modules are used in my project:<br>
* wordcloud<br>
* jieba(this is used to split words in text written with Chinese)<br>
* matplotlib<br>
* scipy<br>
* os<br>
Soon afterwards, I want to get the frequency of the words in one text, and then paint the high frequency words with wordcloud. This function is more useful and interesting.<br>
